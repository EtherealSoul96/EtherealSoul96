## Hi!

I'm currently uploading my projects to GitHub, so they can be incomplete.  
I'll be adding code, descriptions and media in following days.

Some of my code can be untidy because it was made for personal use.  
I often write many comments about different ideas I have to add to my projects, potential solutions and things to keep in mind.
